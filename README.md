## AI-Powered Mood Insights

CampusCare leverages artificial intelligence to enhance student well-being. We have integrated a custom-trained DistilBERT model for mood summary and emotion classification, enabling:

- **Automated Mood Analysis:** Student mood logs are analyzed using a fine-tuned DistilBERT transformer, providing instant, intelligent feedback and summaries.  
- **Emotion Detection:** The AI can classify emotions such as sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, and surprise, helping counselors and students better understand emotional trends.  
- **Custom Model Training:** Our model was trained using the HuggingFace Transformers library and the [Fine-Tuning DistilBERT notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1g2-SgXIYfRwKsJXKmF87VHoONTWupvHs?authuser=2#scrollTo=OCHRSKdJPqwK), ensuring high accuracy and relevance for student mental health data.
